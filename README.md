This is my first c++ project which took me around 5 months to complete.
This is a highly customizable mod for a very old game which includes:
1) An aimbot (automatic aim) for projectile weapons;
2) An ESP (2D OpenGL overlay);
3) Many other gameplay-related utility functions

A video demonstration which explains what it is and what it can do in more detail:
